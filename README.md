### Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹

My name is Adithya, after spending some time in school trying to figure out how computers work, I worked at Geotab, Cineplex and Wave helping build [Geotab Drive]([url](https://www.geotab.com/fleet-management-solutions/eld/)), [Cineplex Store]([url](https://store.cineplex.com/)), and [Wave Money]([url](https://www.waveapps.com/banking)) respectively. These days it seems that whenever I decide to do a project I end up doing it in either JS/TS, Go or C#, but I'm always somewhat fascinated and playing with stuff outside of my daily use.

A few interesting things I have built in the past:
* [CloudCapable]([url](https://github.com/adithya/cloudcapable))
* [ImageRepo]([url](https://github.com/adithya/image-repo))
